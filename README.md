App Engine / AngularJS Stack Demo
=============================

A simple ToDo app to demonstrate Maven, App Engine (Java), Objectify, GSON, AngularJS, and Twitter Bootstrap.

Many standard features are implemented such as tabbed navigation, user authentication, data security, client-side filtering, etc.  This project is intended to be a good starting place for building more comprehensive web applications.

I'm currently working on:
(1) adding a real-time chat tab utilizing the Channel API and;
(2) summary statistics using D3.js and custom AngularJS directives.
